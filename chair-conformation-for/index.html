<p>The chair conformation is considered to be the lowest energy conformation because it lacks both angle strain and torsional strain. Lets get some practice drawing it chair confirmations one way to do it is to start by drawing two parallel lines that are offset from each others let me go ahead and show you what I mean so heres heres one line and then here is another line theyre parallel to each other but theyre offset a little bit next were going to draw two horizontal dotted lines so the top horizontal dotted line is going to be on level with that top. Now draw the first chair conformation by placing the ethyl group UP on an axial bond and the methyl group UP on. However keep in mind that the geometry of the cyclohexane needs to be.

<p>Lets get some practice drawing it chair confirmations one way to do it is to start by drawing two parallel lines that are offset from each others let me go ahead and show you what I mean so heres heres one line and then here is another line theyre parallel to each other but theyre offset a little bit next were going to draw two horizontal dotted lines so the top horizontal dotted line is going to be on level with that top. Although the hydrocarbon cyclohexane is typically drawn as if it were flat in reality the structure is not flat at all. All bonds to hydrogen atoms on adjacent carbon atoms are staggered and therefore torsional strain is minimized. Always place the largesthighest priority group in the equatorial position. 1 2 2 1 3 3 4 4 5 6 6 5 OH H Cl Cl OH Cl Cl H These conformations can then be used to evaluate the absolute or relative steric strain energies.

<p>Chair Conformations Examples. Draw BOTH chairs and compare energy and stability. Dont forget up stays up and down stays down. In a chair conformation Fig1 all of the carboncarbon bond angles are 1095 o and are thereby free of angle strain. Cyclohexane is the most stable cycloalkane.
