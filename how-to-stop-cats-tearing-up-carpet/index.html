Teach your cat that scratching is fine but only on appropriate surfaces. Instead try a variety of other materials such as cardboard wood other textures of carpeting and sisal. To help them move away from inappropriate areas like the carpet or furniture make sure you clean any marks you find with water and a simple soap to remove the scent.

<p>Getting your cat to stop tearing up the carpet isnt always easy. Kitty should quickly learn that scratching at the door makes the monster turn on. I love this simple product CarPET Scratch Stopper that helps stop a cat who scratches and pulls up carpet around doorways. When a cat tries to scratch at the carpet by a closed door its claws will no longer be able to grip onto the carpet and will slide right off the device. CarPET Scratch Stopper.
