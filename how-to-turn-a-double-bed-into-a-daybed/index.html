<p>The majority of twin size beds that I sell get converted to daybeds. Youll need two single mattresses too which you may already have around or you can buy them at the second-hand store as well. I then bought 8 pillows and a dust ruffle and a piece of memory foam that was a gift with the bed. If you have a headboard and footboard attach a piece or two of painted or stained wood running the length of one long side of the bed to make a sofa back. Daybeds always seem luxurious not in and of themselves but the mere fact that you might have room for a daybed seems luxurious.
