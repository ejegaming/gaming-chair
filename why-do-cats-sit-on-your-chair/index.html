<p>The last catchair topic is one I call camouflage cats meaning that your cat will pick a chair to nap on and somehow morph into looking like it is part of the furniture causing you to accidentally sit on them because you did not see them. The cat moves to steal the seat as soon as we move to stand up. Cats do this when they are feeling safe and comfortableif theyre sitting like this they probably think that they dont need to use their claws anytime soon. So when you leave that spot is probably the warmest seat in the house. They may also want to feel your heart beating and your chest is probably one of the warmest and most comfortable places in the house.

<p>If youve been around cats for a long time youve probably experienced their unique personalities. Sometimes they scratch things that we dont want them to which is why it is highly advisable to provide multiple scratching posts or surfaces around your home. Finally one cat will turn around to present his backside for some anal sniffing. Dont worry it doesnt mean that your cat thinks that you are stinky or anything. Suspects pictured below Holly.
