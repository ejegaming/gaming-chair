The most stable conformation of the cyclohexane ring is called the chair conformation. In the previous two posts we have talked about drawing the ring-flip of chair conformations and the A value 13-diaxial interactionsAnd we learned that for a given cyclohexane the axial conformer is less stable than the corresponding equatorial conformerFor example the energy difference of the axial and equatorial isopropyl cyclohexane is 92 kJmol. Although the hydrocarbon cyclohexane is typically drawn as if it were flat in reality the structure is not flat at all.
