<p><strong>Chair Conformation Wedge Dash</strong>, This is because the molecule is cis which essentially means that both these groups must be either on wedges or on dashes. If two groups are on a wedge which means that they are coming out of the plane of the page they are said to be cis or. Wedgedotted line convention to show the proper stereochemistry indicated in the name of the compound.</p>

<p>Cyclohexane chair conformation wedge dash Start by drawing the wedge-dash notation for cis-12-diethylcyclohexane which looks like this Notice that the two ethyl groups are placed on wedges on carbon 1 and on carbon 2. If two groups are on a wedge which means that they are coming out of the plane of the page they are said to be cis or. That is the specific structure for cyclohexane.</p>
<h3 id="draw-the-chair-form-of-cyclohexane">Draw the chair form of cyclohexane.</h3><p>To summarize remember in the E2 reaction of cyclohexanes only the hydrogen opposite to the leaving group wedgedash or dashwedge can participate in the elimination. H 2 Select an answer and submit. That is the specific structure for cyclohexane. The easiest way to explain what cis means is to look at the compounds wedge-dash notation. Remember that the skeleton image shown above is more conveniently drawn but loses the 3 rd dimension information so you have to put it back in the chair to determine which should be bolded and which should be wedge.</p>

Wedge and dash is 2D representation of a 3D object so you cant just turn things upside down obviously. Its important to realize that a chair flip does not turn a wedge into a dash but instead turns an axial into an equatorial. So if you drew a wedge in position 1 and a dash in position 2 it would mean that they are on the same plane - either both axial or both equatorial - assuming that the ring was in a chair conformation.
