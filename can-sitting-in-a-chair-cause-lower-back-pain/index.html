<p>Lying down can help the pain temporarily but the goal should be to get up and move as soon as possible. Pain when sitting can be caused by a number of common problems including problems with the discs that cushion the vertebrae in the back. If your knees are higher than your hips your chair is probably too low. Most peoples backs cant handle this well because their hip muscles arent flexible enough. As mentioned previously there is more than one cause of lower back pain aside from sitting far too long at work. Pin On Lifestyle.</p>
