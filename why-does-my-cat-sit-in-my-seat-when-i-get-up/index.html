<p>Sitting in your spot when you get up shows your dogs affection for you but the chosen spot comes back to the master with no unwanted behavior. Since your cat cannot sweat in the way humans do grooming is used as a way to cool down. Whenever I open the front door my cat will run outside so fast then just sit there and wait for me to pick him up and put him back inside. You know whats Im talking about knocking things off the table cat loafing sleeping in weird places and of course sitting and staring with you. If you keep the toilet seat down when not in use they will pick up on this and stalk an opportunity to get their heads in when its open.
