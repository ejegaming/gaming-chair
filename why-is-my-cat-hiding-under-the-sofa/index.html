<p>I have a cat that for unfortunate reasons lived outside my. Cats usually do this when they feel stressed by the presence of strange people at home so it is likely that if there are visits they hide away and do not show their whiskers around. When I was breeding Siamese cats I watched my mother cat teach the kittens to hide under the sofa when anyone strange came into the room. I do have another cat who is a year old but Ive kept her separated completely. I moved him to my spare bedroom which is much smaller and has less crannies to hide in. Our Kitten Hiding Under The Couch R Aww.</p>
