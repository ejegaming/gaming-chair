<p>When the pneumatic cylinder on your office or computer chair goes kaput as they are wont to do often after just a few years you may find that even the manufacturer doesnt have any suggestions on how to fix it.

Fortunately if you have an issue with adjusting your chairs seat height there is a quick and simple fix when it just stays stuck in the lowest position or will refuse to rise to the highest position. The first thing to check if this happens is the mechanism attached to the lever that can be used to control the height of the chair.
