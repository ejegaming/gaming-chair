A second cat may offer companionship during the day and may lessen those nocturnal urges to wake you for play. One of the best things you can do is to spay and neuter your cats. Delay your cats dinner until very late in the night when you are about to sleep. Reprimanding your cat when hes clawing your rug meowing excessively or otherwise keeping you awake may encourage him to continue that behavior because you are giving him the attention he is seeking.

<p>You should set up multiple sleeping areas for your cat throughout your house or in a room designated for your cat. Manage your cats environment during the night. Letting the cat sleep near you may be comforting to you both. Your cat should learn to wait by the feeder rather than bother you. Expending energy on chewing at night may help to settle them down for a good nights sleep.
