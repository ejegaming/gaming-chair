<p>Subjects sat in an Embody chair and four other chairs with various backrest designs none of which had thoracic adjustment capabilities. This support is due to the use of a technology called dynamic Variable lumber. Another difference between these two chairs is the armrests adjustment. The Sacral Support PostureFit built into our chairs provides fantastic spinal support and the construction of the chair will distribute your weight perfectly. Our headrest for Aeron doesnt void the 12 year chair warranty and is recommended by Herman Miller for bid specs. Herman Miller Embody Headrest Diy Hermanmiller.</p>

<p>The Atlas Aeron Headrest is the missing item for the Aeron chair to provide the support all the way to the neck. And although it has many similar features to Aeron functions it is about 3 times cheaper. It has set a new benchmark for ergonomic seating that supports healthful movement. It has a reclining feature like the Cooler Master Ergo L and Secretlab Titan but it doesnt lock back. The Embody chair provides superior support thanks to its Called Pixelated Support feature that makes use of a matrix of pixels on the seat and mesh back rest.
