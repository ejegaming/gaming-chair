<p>Try apple cider vinegar. Yesterday I found a hidden spot. A cats normal body temperature is 1025 degrees and maintaining it can take work. If you want your cat off a couch or a chair spray that surface down with a commercial cat repellent spray.

<p>You can buy one or two scratching posts or scratching boards and place them around your home in areas that are away from your leather furniture. Buy Scratching Posts or Scratching Boards. Workout by scratching is preferably done in an ergonomic position. You leave your comfy chair for two minutes only to come back and find that your cat has claimed it for himself. Your cat may prefer other materials. Cat Sitting At Window Cat Sitting Beautiful Cat Cat Window.</p>
