<p><strong>Chair Conformation Practice</strong>, The 14 cis compounds most stable chair form has its leaving group Br and beta-hydrogen in an anti-coplanar anti-periplanar in some textbooks conformation. Draw two templates that represents the two chair conformations of cyclohexane and number the carbon atoms. Lets get some practice drawing it chair confirmations one way to do it is to start by drawing two parallel lines that are offset from each others let me go ahead and show you what I mean so heres heres one line and then here is another line theyre parallel to each other but theyre offset a little bit next were going to draw two horizontal dotted lines so the top horizontal dotted line is going to be on level with that top.</p>
