The radiofrequency electromagnetic radiation that mobile phones or phone masts transmit and receive is non-ionising and is very weak. 44 The electromagnetic fields EMFs created by these devices can impact health both physically and mentally and may cause problems for memory learning behavior.

<p>DNA is the chemical that makes up our genes which control how our cells function. Some research suggests a slight increase in the rate of brain tumors since the 1970s but cellphones werent in use during the 1970s. According to western medicine brain cancer is when too many cells grow in the brain tissue. While there are concerns about the proximity to the brain there is no link between headphones and brain cancer.

<p>A study reported in May 1990 issue of AJE found that incidence of brain tumors among children of pregnant women who slept under electric blankets increased 2 times. They based their statement on findings that using a cell phone for 10 years doubles the risk of developing a form of cancerous brain tumor called a glioma the same type that killed Ted Kennedy. His team analyzed existing data from previous studies and found evidence that long-term exposure to the ambient low-dose RFR emitted by our favorite electronic devices is enough to explain not only the development of cancer but also other minor problems seen in the studies such as headache fatigue and skin irritation. Mobile phones are low-powered radio devices that transmit and receive microwave radiation. These are tumours where the tumour cells grow more rapidly and are more likely to spread within the brain.
