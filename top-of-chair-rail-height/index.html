<p>In rooms with 8-foot-high ceilings you can place chair railing between 30 and 48 inches above the floor. Now it depends more on the height of the room. For a standard 8-foot ceiling they should be installed about 32 inches from the floor. About 28 to 32 inches is an optimum range for chair rail height says Hull. The chair rail as it moves from room to room has the ability to tie the rooms together. Correct Chair Rail Height You Need To Know Chair Rail Wayfair Living Room Chairs Home.</p>

Step away from the wall and look at the rail. Most experts place chair rails at one-third the distance of the ceiling height. To be the most visually appealing chair rails need to be installed at the right height. 30 Best Chair Rail Ideas Pictures Decor And Remodel Dining Room Paint Colors Wainscoting Styles Dining Room Chair Rail.</p>
