<p>After painting the chair staple an oval of fabric to the chairback and trim excess fabric. I stripped the old upholstery and nothing was salvageable except for the wood frame and the thin plywood seat back so I cut a new seat base out of MDF with a keyhole saw. All existing fabric foam and springs are removed to expose original frame. The fabric was not cheap at 25yard and I bought 8 yards. Start with something simple like a single chair then when you have built up your confidence and knowledge you can move on to the living room sofa.
