<p>Bridge pose Setu Bandasana Locust pose Salabhasana Cobra pose Bhujangasana Mountain pose Tadasana Ensure your yoga trainer is knowledgeable enough to advise you suitable poses for correcting Kyphosis. A chair with a Dynamic Counterbalancing system that moves with you as you lean forward and back is ideal. Shavasana or the Corpse Pose is a popular position for rest and relaxation. These poses also open up the front of the chest and shoulders which is good for correcting kyphosis. The most valuable poses to include are supported backbends which stretch out shortened chest. 9 030 Likes 29 Comments Yoga Yoga Tuts On Instagram Photo By Simonagyoga Oh The Lizard Pos Lizard Pose Lizard Pose Yoga Gym Workout For Beginners.</p>

<p>We all have a kyphosis or at least we ought to. Finding a good ergonomic chair isnt as easy as heading to the store and buying one thats labeled ergonomic. This is because certain yoga poses and exercises help in strengthening the spine. When the spine curves outwards more than normal at the upper back below the neck. These poses also open up the front of the chest and shoulders which is good for correcting kyphosis.
